					The 'LVM-Storage' plugin transforms a standard Linux-box into a rapid-fast-cloning storage-server
					supporting snap-shotting for NFS-, Aoe-, and Iscsi-filesystem-images.
					The snapshots (clones from a 'golden server image') are immediatly available for deployment and
					saving space on the storage-subsystem because just the delta of the server image is being stored.
