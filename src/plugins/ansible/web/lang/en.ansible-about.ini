			It seamlessly integrates <a href='http://www.ansibleworks.com' target='_BLANK'>Ansible</a> within the openQRM GUI and assists to apply pre-made or custom Ansible Playbooks to specific Server.</p>
			<p>By enabling the plugin the Ansible-environment is pre-configured and initialyzed automatically according to best-practice experiences e.g. by keeping the ansible-configuration within a svn-repsitory.</p>
			<p>Custom Ansible Playbooks can be added to the playbooks directory in the subversion repository. All Playbooks will be automatically displayed in the Ansible plugin server manager.
			A collection of basic Playbooks is provided by openQRM. Those are
			<ul>
				<li>webserver</li>
				<li>database-server</li>
				<li>lamp</li>
			</ul>
			Those provided Playbooks can be of course customized according own requirements. The ansible-configuration repository is also available for external svn clients. To check out the ansible-repo please run:</p>"
