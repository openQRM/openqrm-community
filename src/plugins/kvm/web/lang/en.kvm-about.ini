					   As common in openQRM the Virtual Machines and their virtual disk volumes are managed separately.
					   Therefore the 'KVM' plugin splits up into VM- and Volume-Management.
					   The VM part provides the Virtual Machines which are abstracted as 'Resources'.
					   The Storage part provides volumes which are abstracted as 'Images'.
					   Server deployment automatically combines 'Resource' and 'Image'."
