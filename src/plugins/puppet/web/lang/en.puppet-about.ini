It seamlessly integrates <a href='http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet' target='_blank'>puppet</a> within the openQRM GUI and assists to put specific server into pre-made or custom puppet classes.</p>
			<p>By enabling the plugin the puppet environment (server and client) is pre-configured and initialized automatically according to best-practice experiences e.g. by keeping the puppet configuration within a svn repository.</p>
			<p>The puppet configuration is organized in 'classes' 'groups' and 'Server'. Custom custom classes can be added to the class-directory. Classes should be combined to 'groups' these will be automatically displayed in the puppet plugin.</p>
			<p>The puppet configuration repository is also available for external svn clients. To check out the puppet repository please run:"
