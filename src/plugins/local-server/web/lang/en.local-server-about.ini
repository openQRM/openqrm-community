After integrating an existing, local-installed server it can be used 'grab' the systems root-fs and transform it to an openQRM server-image. It also allows to dynamically deploy network-booted server images while still being able to restore/restart the existing server-system located on the local-harddisk.</p><p>No manual configuration is needed.</p>"

The resource can now be used to e.g. create a new 'storage-server' within openQRM.
