introduction_content = "The 'LinuxCOE' plugin integrates <a href='http://linuxcoe-project.org/' target='_BLANK'>LinuxCOE</a> Install Server for automatic Linux deployments.
			LinuxCOE comes with a user-friendly UI to create automatic Linux installations for different distributions (Debian/Ubuntu/CentOS etc.) resulting in ISO files/images which can be used to
			fully automatically install physical Server and also Virtual Machines.<br>The integration of LinuxCOE in openQRM provides two different modes:<br><br>

				<strong>Automatic Installations from ISO</strong><br>
				After creating an Installation Template the resulting ISO image can be burned on an CD to automatically install a physical Server (the initial goal of the LinuxCOE Project).<br><br>
				In openQRM the LinuxCOE ISO Images are also automatically available on Virtualization Host from the type 'local-deployment VMs' (e.g. 'kvm-storage' and 'xen-storage') in the /linuxcoe-iso directory.
				Simply configure a Virtual Machine to boot from such a LinuxCOE ISO image for an fully automatic VM installation.<br><br>
				Please notice that after a successfull installation the VM will most likely try to boot from the ISO image again after the automatic install procedure finished!
				Please stop the VMs Server after the initial automatic installation, then re-configure the Virtual Machine to boot from 'local' and start the Server again.<br><br>

				<strong>Automatic Network-Installations</strong><br>
				The LinuxCOE integration in openQRM provides the capability to use the pre-configured automatic installations templates also for 'network-deployment'.
				For 'network-deployment' physical Server and Virtual Machines from the type 'local-deployment for VMs' (e.g. 'kvm-storage' and 'xen-storage') are supported.<br>
				-> physical Server and VMs for 'network-deployment' must be set to network-boot (PXE) either in the BIOS or VM configuration!<br><br>
				The deployment of the LinuxCOE templates works via openQRMs 'install-from-template' mechanism which allows to attach those automatic installation templates to Images.
				For Virtual Machines the templates can be directly attached to the Virtual Machines Image, for physical Server please create an Image pointing to a local disk with the LinuxCOE 'Image Manager'.<br><br>
				Starting an Server with an LinuxCOE automatic installation template attached to its Image automatically applies the specified configuration and automatically installs the systems.<br><br>
				Network-deploying LinuxCOE templates automatically installs the openQRM-Client and integrates the system into openQRM.
				After the automatic installation the resource (physical Server or VM) is automatically set to local-boot.<br><br>

				<strong>Cloud deployment</strong><br>
				Images with an attached LinuxCOE <strong>Automatic Network-Installation</strong> template are fully supported for Cloud-deployment!<br><br>"
