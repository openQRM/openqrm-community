31.05.2012 - openQRM 5.0



31.10.2011	- for the 4.9 release - released 31. October 2011

			###############################################################################################################
			Base:

			- enhanced openQRM's "appliance model" with an "install from template" work-flow
			  This new, additional work-flow in openQRM is again fully modular and can be implemented by a plugin.
			  It now supports to "plug in" different automatic-installation tools (like e.g. the install server Cobbler)
			  to provide the deployment actions for physical and virtual systems.
			  Currently the following plugins are already available to be used with this new "install from template" work-flow :

				* Clonezilla	Automated local provision by disk-imaging (cloning of the disk-content) for Windows and Linux
						http://clonezilla.org/

				* Cobbler		Unattended local Linux installation (focus on RedHat/CentOS)
						https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler/

				* FAI		Unattended local Linux installation (focus on Debian/Ubuntu)
						http://fai-project.org/

				* LinuxCOE		Unattended local Linux installation (supports a variety of different Linux distributions)
						http://linuxcoe.sourceforge.net/

				* Opsi		Unattended local installation for Windows Systems (including Hardware/Software-Inventory, Package- and License-Management)
						http://www.opsi.org/

			  All above mentioned functionalities and features are also automatically available in the openQRM Cloud!
			  That means that openQRM can be used as the Middleware to attach an existing Cobbler, FAI, LinuxCOE and/or Opsi environments to Cloud Computing.

			  More infos at http://www.openqrm-enterprise.com/news/details/article/openqrm-brings-clonezilla-cobbler-fai-linuxcoe-and-opsi-into-the-cloud.html

			QA Report - Supported Distribution for the openQRM Server

			For the openQRM Server itself we recommend a Debian or Ubuntu (LTS) Linux distribution!
			-> Especially for the openQRM 4.9 release we have included a set of improvements and QA to enhance the "user experience" of openQRM also on CentOS.

			For the managed physical systems and the deployment of Virtual Machines openQRM supports all mainstream Linux and Windows Distributions (and versions)
			-> independent from the Linux Distribution the openQRM Server is running on.
